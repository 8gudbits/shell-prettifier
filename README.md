**Tip 1:** _To disable neofetch from launching with the terminal, you can modify the file `~/.zshrc` and comment out the last line from the file and save it._

**Tip 2:** _Keep the terminal profile backup file that will be created by `install_profile.sh` script incase you want to revert to your old terminal settings._

**Tip 3:** _You can use the wallpaper from `.shell-prettifier/wallpaper/` to match the color palette._

## Fixing font

_If you are having issues where special characters and icons are not displayed correctly, I recommend downloading another fixed version of the font instead._

_Here is how you can install Menlo-for-Powerline font:_

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abertsch/Menlo-for-Powerline.git
```

_After downloading you can add the font to your fonts folder:_

```bash
cd Menlo-for-Powerline
cp "Menlo for Powerline.ttf" ~/.fonts
```

_Lastly, you will need to select the font in your terminals preferences/settings._

## How to reset

_If you want to revert to your old terminal settings, you can load the backup that was made by the `install_profile.sh` script while installing using this command:_

```bash
dconf load /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/ < ~/terminal_profile_backup.dconf
```

_Then, you can reset your shell back to bash with the following command:_

```bash
chsh -s $(which bash)
```

_Now you can remove the packages that were installed by the script, the packages are:_

```bash
pv git git-core zsh neofetch curl
```
